```js
// YourComponent.stories.js | YourComponent.stories.jsx

// Replacing the <Story/> element with a Story function is also a good way of writing decorators.
// Useful to prevent the full remount of the component's story.
export default {
  component: YourComponent,
  decorators: [
    (Story) => (
      <div style={{ margin: '3em' }}>
        {Story()}
      </div>
    ),
  ],
}
```
